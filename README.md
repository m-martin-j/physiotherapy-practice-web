# Website

This website is based on the Serif theme (credit: https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/jekyll-serif-theme).

It employs [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) v5.3.3


## Pages
* If the the head title of the page shall correspond to `site.title`, use `title: SITE.TITLE` in the front matter of a page. (Function maintained in [_layouts/default.html](_layouts/default.html))

### Home Page
* Intro image
  * If it is changed, tweaking in [_sass/components/_intro-image.scss](_sass/components/_intro-image.scss) might become necessary.
  * It could look nice, if it is very white on the left, as the text and the call box could be placed overlapping.
