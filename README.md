## Style
### Fonts
* This project uses Arial as base font and self-hosted Quicksand as heading font
* For using variable fonts (such as Quicksand), see e.g. [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_fonts/Variable_fonts_guide).
* Source
  * pre-load font in HTML: [_layouts/default.html](_layouts/default.html)
  * process font in scss: [_sass/components/_fonts.scss](_sass/components/_fonts.scss)
  * set font-family-related variable in scss: [assets/css/style.scss](assets/css/style.scss)


## Development
* Dependencies: ruby with gems, jekyll, bundler (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
* Launch website serving
  ```sh
  bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl "/"  # optionally add --verbose
  ```
* Update gems (e.g. to match the dependencies on the build system)
  ```sh
  bundle update
  ```


## Understanding Jekyll
### Assets
* CSS and SASS/SCSS (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/07-assets/)
  1. Necessary files: /assets/css/<STYLE_SHEET_FILE_NAME>.scss (or .css)
  1. Imports in the .scss file are typically searched in the _sass folder on root level
  1. Jekyll builds the file /assets/css/<STYLE_SHEET_FILE_NAME>.scss to a _site/assets/css/<STYLE_SHEET_FILE_NAME>.css file
  1. An html (index) file needs to link the built css file with the correct name using `<link href="{{ '/assets/css/<STYLE_SHEET_FILE_NAME>.css' | relative_url }}" rel="stylesheet">` in the header

## Usage
* Jekyll
  ```sh
  bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl "/"
  ```
