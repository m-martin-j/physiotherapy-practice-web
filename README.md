# Website

## Pages
* If the the head title of the page shall correspond to `site.title`, use `title: SITE.TITLE` in the front matter of a page. (Function maintained in [_layouts/default.html](_layouts/default.html))
* The `role` attribute is currently only used for page `services`. It enables identifying a page to be included as parent page in breadcrumbs.

### Home Page
* Intro image
  * If it is changed, tweaking in [_sass/components/_intro-image.scss](_sass/components/_intro-image.scss) might become necessary.
  * It could look nice, if it is very white on the left, as the text and the call box could be placed overlapping.

## Footer/Sub-Footer
### Footer
TBD

### Sub-Footer
#### Socials
* Source
  * Data: Data is included based on [_data/social.json](_data/social.json); expected fields per item are:
    ```json
    "name": "<name of the social element>",
    "link": "<link to the social element's web presence/URI>",
    "image": "images/social/<image file, svg preferred>"
    ```
    * special case: If the `"name"` value equals to `"E-Mail"`, no further json fields are evaluated. Further data is read from [_data/contact.yml](_data/contact.yml).
  * Layout: [_includes/social.html](_includes/social.html)


## Style
### Fonts
* This project uses Arial as base font (Helvetica only if the user happens to have it installed) and self-hosted Quicksand as heading font.
* For using variable fonts (such as Quicksand), see e.g. [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_fonts/Variable_fonts_guide).
* Source
  * pre-load font in HTML: [_layouts/default.html](_layouts/default.html)
  * process font in scss: [_sass/components/_fonts.scss](_sass/components/_fonts.scss)
  * set font-family-related variable in scss: [assets/css/style.scss](assets/css/style.scss)


## Development
* Dependencies: ruby with gems, jekyll, bundler (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
* Launch website serving
  ```sh
  bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl "/"  # optionally add --verbose
  ```
* Update gems (e.g. to match the dependencies on the build system)
  ```sh
  bundle update
  ```


## Understanding Jekyll
### Assets
* CSS and SASS/SCSS (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/07-assets/)
  1. Necessary files: /assets/css/<STYLE_SHEET_FILE_NAME>.scss (or .css)
  1. Imports in the .scss file are typically searched in the _sass folder on root level
  1. Jekyll builds the file /assets/css/<STYLE_SHEET_FILE_NAME>.scss to a _site/assets/css/<STYLE_SHEET_FILE_NAME>.css file
  1. An html (index) file needs to link the built css file with the correct name using `<link href="{{ '/assets/css/<STYLE_SHEET_FILE_NAME>.css' | relative_url }}" rel="stylesheet">` in the header

## Usage
* Jekyll
  ```sh
  bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl "/"
  ```


## Hosting
### Apache
#### Redirect
* http to https: This is achieved via a `.htaccess` file, placed inside the web root directory (e.g. `/var/www/your_domain/.htaccess` or at parent locations - see also the documentation of [Apache.org](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/howto/htaccess.html#when)), with the following content:
  ```
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]
  ```
