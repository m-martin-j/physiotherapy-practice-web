## Pages
* The `role` attribute is currently only used for page `services`. It enables identifying a page to be included as parent page in breadcrumbs.

### Home Page
* Intro image
  * If it is changed, tweaking in [_sass/components/_intro-image.scss](_sass/components/_intro-image.scss) might become necessary.
  * It could look nice, if it is very white on the left, as the text and the call box could be placed overlapping.

## Style
### Fonts
* This project uses Arial as base font (Helvetica only if the user happens to have it installed) and self-hosted Quicksand as heading font.
* For using variable fonts (such as Quicksand), see e.g. [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_fonts/Variable_fonts_guide).
* Source
  * pre-load font in HTML: [_layouts/default.html](_layouts/default.html)
  * process font in scss: [_sass/components/_fonts.scss](_sass/components/_fonts.scss)
  * set font-family-related variable in scss: [assets/css/style.scss](assets/css/style.scss)

### Animations
* fly-in
  * Source
    * SCSS: [_sass/components/_animation.scss](_sass/components/_animation.scss) - `@keyframes flyIn`, `data-inviewport`
    * JavaScript: [assets/js/scripts.js](assets/js/scripts.js)
    * example HTML: [_layouts/about.html](_layouts/about.html)
  * Usage:
    * globally, any CSS class can use the flyIn animation keyframes
    * The style variable `--fly-in-start-x` can be optionally overwritten. E.g. negative percentage values to fly in from the left.
    * Optionally, html elements can be assigned the `data-inviewport` attribute. Then, the animation will only be activated once it is visible in the viewport via JavaScript.
      * Additionally, the HTML attributes `data-root-margin` and `data-threshold` can optionally be set to control options passed to the IntersectionObserver (deviating from default values).
      * Additionally, the HTML attribute `data-insuccession` can optionally be set (with arbitrary value) to apply the keyframes on the children with delay and increasing horizontal displacement one after another


## Cookies
* Data
  * validity duration: [_config.yml](_config.yml) - `cookies.expiry_days`
* JavaScript: [assets/js/scripts.js](assets/js/scripts.js) - section `cookies`
  * Logic:
    * If an HTML element is assigned the attribute `data-cookie-consent`, the embedding of third-party code is prevented until the user's cookie consent is verified (function `checkCookieConsent`). The value of this attribute needs to correspond to the name of a function in the scripts file. If appropriate consent is given, this function will embed necessary elements.
    * If an HTML element is ADDITIONALLY assigned the attribute `data-cookie-consent-necessary`, only necessary consent needs to be given by the user (for functional necessities of the website). If this attribute is not assigned, a consent add button for delayed user consent is shown.
* HTML
  * consent banner: [_includes/cookie-consent-banner.html](_includes/cookie-consent-banner.html)
  * consent add button: [_includes/cookie-consent-add-button.html](_includes/cookie-consent-add-button.html)


## Third-Party Integrations
### Contact Form
* HTML: [_includes/contact-form.html](_includes/contact-form.html)
* JavaScript: [assets/js/scripts.js](assets/js/scripts.js) - section `contact form` and `embed Google ReCAPTCHA`
* Data: [_data/third-party.yml](_data/third-party.yml)

### Google Maps
* JavaScript: [assets/js/scripts.js](assets/js/scripts.js) - section `embed Google Maps`
* Data: [_data/third-party.yml](_data/third-party.yml)


## Development
* Dependencies: ruby with gems, jekyll, bundler (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
* Launch website serving
  ```sh
  bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl "/"  # optionally add --verbose
  ```
* Update gems (e.g. to match the dependencies on the build system)
  ```sh
  bundle update
  ```
* bots: a curated list for [robots.xml](robots.xml) to prevent scraping for AI training purposes: https://neil-clarke.com/block-the-bots-that-feed-ai-models-by-scraping-your-website/


## Problems
* Encountered sticky header to flow out to top on scroll down, horizontally non-centered main-menu-mobile --> solved by applying `overflow: hidden` on `.intro` ([_sass/components/_intro.scss](_sass/components/_intro.scss))


## Understanding Jekyll
### Assets
* CSS and SASS/SCSS (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/07-assets/)
  1. Necessary files: /assets/css/<STYLE_SHEET_FILE_NAME>.scss (or .css)
  1. Imports in the .scss file are typically searched in the _sass folder on root level
  1. Jekyll builds the file /assets/css/<STYLE_SHEET_FILE_NAME>.scss to a _site/assets/css/<STYLE_SHEET_FILE_NAME>.css file
  1. An html (index) file needs to link the built css file with the correct name using `<link href="{{ '/assets/css/<STYLE_SHEET_FILE_NAME>.css' | relative_url }}" rel="stylesheet">` in the header

## Usage
* Jekyll
  ```sh
  bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl "/"
  ```
* Jekyll with SSL encryption for development
  * Create an SSL crt and key and move them into folder `custom_cert`
  * Serve
    ```sh
    bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl "/" --ssl-key custom_cert/localhost.key --ssl-cert custom_cert/localhost.crt
    ```


## Hosting
### Apache
#### Redirect
* http to https: This is achieved via a `.htaccess` file, placed inside the web root directory (e.g. `/var/www/your_domain/.htaccess` or at parent locations - see also the documentation of [Apache.org](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/howto/htaccess.html#when)), with the following content:
  ```
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]
  ```
